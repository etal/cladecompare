"""Hypergeometric Distribution

    Gendankenexperiment:
    
	Foreground and background sequence sets are pre-defined.

	Given N foreground sequences and M-N background sequences,
    we randomly select N sequences from M.  We consider the consensus
    residue in the foreground as being type I and ask what is the probability
    of observing at least as many type I sequences in our selection as we see
    in the foreground.
